<p>Join or die is an alliance run by Ceremor, a pirate and <strong>NOT</strong> a griefer. I have respect for Ceremor but because I am a deserter and the people of Worlds Adrift are being harmed he must be stopped! Ceremor has a&nbsp;<a title="Ceremors Twitch channel" href="https://www.twitch.tv/ceremor">Twitch</a>&nbsp;channel where he goes and hunts down deserters&nbsp;(people who have left), and tries to "encourage" more people to join.&nbsp;</p>
