<p>You can help a few ways. The first and probably&nbsp;most effective is to actually fight Ceremor and high-level alliance members. You can also choose to die over Join. This will help because&nbsp;the fewer people in the alliance the better (note that I do not advise leaving if you are already in because you will be hunted down if you do). If you don't have the power to fight or the courage to die you can spread this website. I promise I am not making any money from this site. You can look all through the code, in fact here is the GitHub&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/joinordontjoin/main/blob/master/howcanihelp.html" target="_blank">repository</a>.&nbsp;</p>
